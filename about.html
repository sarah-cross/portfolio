            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I had an aha moment while reading <em>Hidden Figures</em>. Dorothy Vaughan realized that in order to secure her future at NASA, she needed to learn computers. She saw that computers were the way of the future and determined to learn them. It got me thinking, <em>why have I never even considered anything in STEM?</em> It was the right time to try something new as my husband was getting out of the army as a disabled veteran and our four kids would be in school.</p>
            <p>Over the next weeks I checked out library books like <em>Coding for Kids</em> and wrote my first "Hello World" program. By fall I was enrolled in Auburn University's computer science program, where I ended up graduating Summa Cum Laude with a 4.0 GPA.</p>
            <p>Since then, I landed an internship with the OKC Thunder NBA team, where I worked on a full-stack application for player evaluations--- a dream job for me as a lifelong athlete and sports fan! My project involved data visualization and tools to help scouts and coaches give more nuanced and accurate analyses.</p>
            <p>I'm currently working on a personal project called <em>Race the States</em> that also brings my passion for all things athletics into programming. I have a goal of running a half marathon in all 50 states, so I decided to build an app to help track my progress and find upcoming races.</p>
            <p>My experience as an army wife, through combat deployments and moves across the country, has made me adaptable and calm under pressure. And my years of being a mom, a marathon runner, and a computer science student have shaped me into a driven learner, determined to do things well. I am currently seeking a full-time software engineering position where I can leverage my skills in full-stack development and data visualization.
